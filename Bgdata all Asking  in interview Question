questions according to your project

********8Citi Bank codility test***************************
Question 

1Write a function solution that, given two integers A and B, returns a string containing exactly A letters 'a' and exactly B letters 'b' with no three consecutive letters being the same (in other words, neither "aaa" nor "bbb" may occur in the returned string).

2
A positive integer N is given. The goal is to find the highest power of 2 that divides N. In other words, we have to find the maximum K for which N modulo 2^K is 0

For example, given integer N = 24 the answer is 3, because 2^3 = 8 is the highest power of 2 that divides N.


3
that, given an array A of N integers, returns the smallest positive integer (greater than 0) that does not occur in A.

For example, given A = [1, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2], the function should return 5.

For me most programing questions were asked from python and in all interview spark was most theory question and SQL one or two at most queries were asked
And in spark they will ask similar dataframe operation like we do in SQL example total transaction amount at every branch of given bank on specific day , they will give us dataframe with column then you have to write all the transformation you would do to obtain the result
Besides this there were like scenario based questions like what were the problems or errors that you encountered in you project
[12:21 In python the most common theory question will be difference between list, set and tuple
[12:22 And common python  programing questions will be string manipulation related or sorting a tuple or list both strings and numbers
